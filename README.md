# YATL

Yet Another To-do List

## What's this all about

This is experimental project where I'm step by step write redux-like application from scratch.

The goals are:

* Business logic is free from any platform-dependent code
* Be testable, to make sure everything works as you planned.
* Utilise declarative nature of Flutter
* Be granular as much as needed, so people can work together.

## Tests included

* Widget testing
* Unit testing
* Integration testing
